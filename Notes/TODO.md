Level Desing:
- Blockout 

Bugfixes and Changes:

-  Spawning Carrots AOE

Spawning carrots ability should deal AOE damage instead of using projectiles. 
Currently projectiles hit the player and interupt the animation.

### Enemies

1. Cucumber enemy

It has for now three types of attacks:

How can you dodge them or evade them? Can you stop them with an attack? 
Can you blink past them?

The tomato enemy has no short range attack.
The long range jump attack also needs a lot of improvement.


3. Brocolli enemy
