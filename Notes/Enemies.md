# Enemies

## Enemy progression

How to make some creatures in your game and making them naturally harder.

How to make spawn points to spawn more difficult groups as you go along.

More enemies is harder.
More variety is harder. 
    More variety in individuals.
    More variety in groups.

The bandit encounter

1. First time its only one bandit.
2. Second progression is a couple bandits. One of them maybe ranged.
3. Third progression there are five and maybe more weapons.
4. Fourth is the same bandits but now they have attack wolves.

Attack Variation:
- Melee (can be parried), good units to flank a player to provide parry and defense opportunities.
- Ranged (attack from distance), tactics and defenses from a player.
- AOE ranged attacks that damage an area.
- Better weapons (knife, sword, two handed) and armor (no armor, chain, plate)
- Limited use weapons (one rocket rocket launcher) takes time to load.
- Movement (walk up to you), sprinting, jumping, hover, flying units (hard to melee only)
- Summons units bring more units
- Environmental attacks (bandits set traps around camps)
- Environemental tactics take cover (duch behind chairs, trying to get cover from ranged fire)
- Environmental hazards left from an attack.

Attacks that are charged from killing enemies are better when there are many enemies.

Mixing groups of enemies can be fun and unexpected.
