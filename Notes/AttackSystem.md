# Implementing Attack System for Kitchen Battles

## Attack:

1. Check Attack Conditions

-   If the player is dead, they cannot attack
-   If the player is stunned, they cannot attack
-   If the player is rolling, they cannot attack
-   If the player is out of stamina, they cannot attack
-   If the player is drawing the weapon, they cannot attack
-   Else player can attack

2. Send off Attack

3. Calculate the Weapon Attack - Which attack to use

The weapon attack is based on several variables:

-   Number of Weapon Attacks
-   Attack Count index
