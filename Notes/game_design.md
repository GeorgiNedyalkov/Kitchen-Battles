If you have an eggplant, it can guard a brocolli enemy. For example:
Melee enemies can tank damage and be more aggresive than range enemies, which can hide and run.

#### AI

Right now enemies have to see you to agro. Make them agro on spawn.

## Spawning Enemies

Right now we have spawners that each spawn different types of enemies.
Maybe create spawners that spawn only one type of enemy.
